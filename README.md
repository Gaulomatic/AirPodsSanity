# AirPodsSanity

Keeps you from loosing your sanity when using AirPods with a Mac.

You ever wondered, why the audio quality of your beloved AirPods can get as bad as talking to people over some wire that was built during the Apollo missions took place in the 60s? Ask no further, you came to the right place!

## Because... reasons

The technical reason is simple: Bluetooth has a low bandwidth. So when Apple decided to set your AirPods microphone as the one in charge every. single. time. you connect them to your Mac, things go downhill - fast. Only Steve Jobs in his grave can answer the hard questions: Why, Apple?

## What it does

What this app does is super-duper simple and trivial: Select a default input device, and mark one or more output device as "AirPods". Whenever those come online, the selected input device will be maintained.

## How it improves your life

So what that means is, you can live your life in pease, harmony and appreciate the rainbows and unicorns - once this app is installed.

## What it doesn't do

This piece of software is not cloud-native, has no micro service architecture, did not follow DDD principals, contains an algorithm designed by a fool, can not scale (neither vertically nor horizontally) and abuses your sense of humor.

## Features

- Keeps you healthy
- Makes life better
- Protects your sanity

## Roadmap

- Asking Steve in an upcoming session, why this is even a thing
